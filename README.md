# General Summary

A small game where you play as a Samurai and battle another Samurai, I am currently implementing a mode where the player battles another player present
physically, that is, one plays with the arrow keys and the other plays with the WASD keys. I then plan to implement an CPU mode where the player battles
a samurai controlled by the computer.

# Installation

The game is not installable. Simply clone the repo and run the main.py file. You need to install pygame as it is a dependency.
